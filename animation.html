                The first animation we made was an rotoscope animation of Thomas the Tank Engine on a toy track. I rotoscoped the train and added my own touch, which was the train disintegrated.

                The next animation was also a rotoscope animation. This one was of an aeroplane that I recorded flying over my head in Rarotonga. I also added my own touch to this animation, which was when the plane flew into a giant mout tat ate it.
